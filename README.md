# Notary is still a work in progress and we invite contributions and reviews from the security community. It will need to go through a formal security review process before it should be used in production.

# Notary

## Overview

The Notary project comprises a [server](cmd/notary-server) and a [client](cmd/notary) for running and interacting
with trusted collections. Please see the READMEs for the individual tools for
more information on their specifics.

## Goals

Notary aims to make the internet more secure by making it easy for people to
publish and verify content. We often rely on TLS to secure our communications
with a web server which is inherently flawed, as any compromise of the server
enables malicious content to be substituted for the legitimate content.

With Notary, publishers can sign their content offline using keys kept highly
secure. Once the publisher is ready to make the content available, they can
push their signed trusted collection to a Notary Server.

Consumers, having acquired the publisher's public key through a secure channel,
can then communicate with any notary server or (insecure) mirror, relying
only on the publisher's key to determine the validity and integrity of the
received content.

# Docker integration

As of Docker 1.8 you can do trusted operations using notary. This integration

- currently has limited functionaility, allowing a user to transparently push and

## Synopsis

At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.

## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contributors

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.

## License
